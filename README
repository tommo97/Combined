This is a vorticity-transport solver originally for modelling tidal turbine rotorsystems. It uses a finite volume scheme with a fast-multipole method based on heirarchal domain decomposition via octrees. This facilitates vorticity tracking in an arbitrary Eulerian/Lagrangian manner. The boundary conditions are via a boundary-element mesh.
